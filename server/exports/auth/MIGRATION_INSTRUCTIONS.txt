PASSWORD MIGRATION INSTRUCTIONS
================================

STRATEGY: Force Password Reset (Recommended)
--------------------------------------------

Since Supabase password hashes cannot be directly exported, we will use
a temporary password approach with forced password reset.

STEPS:
------

1. IMPORT USERS TO MYSQL
   - Use the import script with users_for_migration.json
   - Each user will be created with a temporary password
   - Temporary passwords are stored in password_reset_list.json

2. SEND PASSWORD RESET EMAILS
   - Use the email service to send reset emails to all users
   - Include instructions for setting new password
   - Provide support contact for issues

3. USER FIRST LOGIN
   - Users receive email with reset link
   - Users click link and set new password
   - Users can then login normally

4. MONITORING
   - Track password reset completion rate
   - Send reminder emails after 7 days
   - Provide manual reset option for support

SECURITY NOTES:
---------------
- Temporary passwords are cryptographically secure (32 hex characters)
- Temporary passwords are only valid for 24 hours
- Password reset tokens expire after use
- All passwords are hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)

FILES GENERATED:
----------------
- supabase_auth_users_raw.json     : Raw Supabase auth data (backup)
- users_for_migration.json         : Transformed data for import
- password_reset_list.json         : Email + temp password mapping
- users_migration.csv              : Human-readable format
- _auth_export_summary.json        : Export statistics and metadata

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Review the exported data
2. Run the import script: node scripts/import-auth-users.js
3. Send password reset emails: node scripts/send-password-resets.js
4. Monitor user migration progress
